MNIST Hyperparameters was a project done in my AI class during summer 2020. I tested a variety of different combinations of hyperparameters to determine their effectivness on a deep learning network that read in pictures of hand drawn digits and classified them as 0-9. The digits were generated based on the MNIST dataset and then used to train the network.
